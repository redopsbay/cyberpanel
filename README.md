## Why i created this script?
I created this script because we would need to migrate all our wordpress, joomla, drupal site to a secure control panel.
And we discover this control panel called cyberpanel and use this as alternative. But the control panel Web Ui is very slow and decided to create a script a Friendly Ui for CLI Users. There is already a CLI command called "cyberpanel", but you need to memorize some sort of parameters to use the command-line.

## Run Script
```
[root@cyberpanel ~]# curl -qO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redopsbay/cyberpanel/master/cyberpanel-cli.sh
[root@cyberpanel ~]# chmod +x cyberpanel-cli.sh
[root@cyberpanel ~]# mv -v cyberpanel-cli.sh /usr/local/bin/
[root@cyberpanel ~]# cyberpanel-cli.sh
```
